<div class="title1">Things That Went Well In The Stream</div>
<center>
<button class="collapsible">Communication / Interaction Between Streamers</button>
            <div class="content">
			<p>Between all of us, we all communicated really well. We shared our own opinions about the coffee freely and without problem, and we all communicated in a casual way that made it look like we had a script, although we do not.</p>
            </div>

            <button class="collapsible">The Flow of the Stream</button>
            <div class="content">
			<p>Our flow was continuous, with no stopping and no dead space within the stream, which I think is a very big positive since the viewers were constantly entertained and not bored because we had long pauses in between.</p>
            </div>

            <button class="collapsible">Organization and Casualty</button>
            <div class="content">
			<p>We were very organized and civilized most of the time, and the flow was connected to our very organized setup since we had all the coffee lined up so that we did not have to scramble around and look for what the next coffee would be. Like stated before, we had that casualty in our tone and our manner that it was almost like we had a script, but we did not.</p>
            </div>
            <button class="collapsible">Props used in the Stream</button>
            <div class="content">
			<p>Prior to the stream, we had bought 15 types of coffee and only drank 13 since we could not drink all of them because we were starting to shake pretty uncontrollably. We had all the coffee, water, and milk on the table so that we could be prepared and ready all throughout the stream. </p>
            </div>

            <button class="collapsible">The use of Tagalog Language</button>
            <div class="content">
			<p>In the last stream we spoke tagalog and in this stream we kept the tagalog to 0 and we were surprised since we did not have a script. </p>
            </div>
            
            <button class="collapsible">The Usage of a Criteria</button>
            <div class="content">
			<p>We made a criteria prior to the stream also since we did not want a bias rating and we had based our rating off the criteria.</p>
            </div>
</center>
<br><br>
            <div class="title1">Areas Of Opportunity</div>
            <center>
            <button class="collapsible">WiFI Connection</button>
                        <div class="content">
						<p>Prior to the stream, we did not take the wifi connection into account and thought that it would be fine since in our last stream the wifi was fine and we did not have any problems like buffering and such, but in this stream we were outside and the wifi connection was not in the best conditions, so with that, we had buffering issues and we had 1 stream stop, but we resolved that within a matter of minutes and reshared the link with everyone.</p>
                        </div>
            
                        <button class="collapsible">Software Error</button>
                        <div class="content">
						<p>The software error was not noticed until half of the stream was done since on our side (the streamers side) in our OBS the chat box was just fine but on the youtube it was just all black and it was a little bit too late when we noticed it. </p>
                        </div>
            
                        <button class="collapsible">The Venue</button>
                        <div class="content">
						<p>We had a slight problem with the venue since we were a little cramped and we had to squeeze a little bit.</p>
                        </div>

<div class="figuretext">
We had the same peak and average viewership in the stream of 9 for the peak and 5-6 for the average. 
<br><br>
We think that it affected us in a very positive way, we all agreed that whatever the viewership is, whatever the chat rate is, we would all have fun since this might be the very last stream we would have. But the viewers and the chat rate exceeded our expectations and we had a lot of fun interacting with the viewers. 

We had a high viewership, we all think that we had a great amount of viewers and chatters, we had a lot of fun interacting 
with all of them, the reason that we had this amount of viewers was because we shared twice both in facebook and instagram stories and in our timelines, and at the day of the stream we also shared in our personal GCs and in the school GCs.

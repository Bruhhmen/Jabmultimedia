<div class="title1">Things That Happened In The Stream</div>

<div class="about">
  We started the stream at our target time of 3:00 p.m., though we started getting ready at around 2:50 p.m. so that we could mentally get ready and prepare all of our gear, and so on. The stream went like this: introducing the topic of the stream, types of caffeine, about the types of caffeine (coffee, energy drinks, tea, soda, etc.), fun facts about the types of caffeine (randomly), effects of caffeinated drinks mostly coffee (positive and negative), academic effects of caffeinated drinks mostly coffee (positive and negative), conclusion, and a Q&A. We did all of these in a span of 57:26 minutes, making it, in our opinion, a really successful stream. Within the stream, a lot of viewer interaction happened since we did advertise in the school GC and online.

<button class="collapsible">The flow of the stream. </button>
            <div class="content">
            <p>We followed our set time for starting, the topics, and most of the script. We may have gone off-script, but we still kept it within our topic.</p>
            </div>

            <button class="collapsible">Keeping the stream within the topic.</button>
            <div class="content">
            <p>Keeping the conversations within topic was not hard since we all had practice before the stream so that we could execute the stream as best as we could and without a lot of out-of-topic parts.</p>
            </div>

            <button class="collapsible">The usage of the script.</button>
            <div class="content">
                <p>We as a group made sure that we knew what was in the script, how long the script would last, and to what extent we could prolong our conversations. We might not have used the script to its full extent since we wanted to add our own insights with the guidance of the script and the research we have done.</p>
            </div>
            <button class="collapsible">Viewer interaction.</button>
            <div class="content">
            <p>We interacted with our viewers really well; most of the time spent was with the Q&A. In the last part, we even stopped the flow of the stream just to interact with the viewers at some points in the stream.</p>
            </div>

            <button class="collapsible">Communication between the panelists. </button>
            <div class="content">
            <p>Since our stream was a podcast and we all needed to have good conversations so that the stream wouldn't be boring and dull, we achieved that to a certain extent since we were still nervous and this was our first time doing a live stream. I think we did pretty well. We took our insights and shared them with everyone, making sure that everyone got a chance to say what's on their mind.</p>

            <div class="title1">Conclusion</div>
            <div class="figuretext">
              To conclude everything that was stated above we did a lot of things that went well, these are our communication skills between each other and the viewers, keeping everything within topic and script. We had good conversations between each other and talked about different things and talked about our own insights on the topic, on the viewer interaction part we had a Q&A part and we asked our viewers for questions and we answered as much as possible, even if it was not the Q&A part there were still some questions with the viewers and we still answered them so that our stream would not be boring. Keeping everything within topic was easy since we had practice before and knew everything that we needed to do.

            <button class="collapsible">The way we talk.</button>
                        <div class="content">
                        <p>We did our best to speak as professionally as we could, but at some points in the stream, it got lost in our minds that we still had to be professional, and we spoke more in a leisurely way.</p>
                        </div>
            
                        <button class="collapsible">The usage of tagalog words.</button>
                        <div class="content">
                        <p>Our plan was to speak full English and no Tagalog at all, but just like the way we wanted to talk, some Tagalog words got to slip through, and we spoke a little bit of Tagalog, counting the comments from the viewers; some of them were in Tagalog, and as much as we wanted to translate them, it was too hard to do it on the spot.</p>
                        </div>
            
                        <button class="collapsible">Our attire or clothing of choice.</button>
                        <div class="content">
                            <p>Just like the two other points above, we think that our attire needs more work and needs to be more presentable. Though we all think that our attire is fine since it is what we are all comfortable with and what we want to wear, we did have a plan for what we needed to wear, and that was our school uniform, so that we looked consistent, but that was not followed, and we all wore different things.</p>

                        <div class="title1">Conclusion</div>
                        <div class="figuretext">
                          Since there are things that we did well there are things that we did not, as a group we did not speak as professionally as we can, we could have done better in speaking professionally but we spoke leisurely at some points of the stream. As much as we wanted to speak full english on the stream there were some words that slipped through and in the comments that we read from the viewers. Our attire was far from perfect. We were supposed to wear one attire to look consistent and professional.

<div class="subtitle">Figure 1: Engagement between the viewers </div>

<div class="figuretext">According to the graph above, we had a pretty decent amount of engagement all throughout the stream since we had an average of 5–9 chats all throughout the stream. We, as the streamers and panelists of the podcast, tried our best to interact with all the comments, but as much as we tried, there were probably some comments that we couldn't answer because we might have missed them or they were just out of topic, and we didn't want to answer them because of that. We think that the amount of engagement that we received had an overall positive impact on the stream and on us. We were overall happy with the engagement that everyone was giving, and we happily answered a lot of questions that were given to us, making a more engaging and not so boring live stream.</div>

<div class="subtitle2">Figure 2: Live Viewers</div>

<div class="figuretext">This graph is from when we were live, and it shows how many concurrent and peak viewers we had on stream. Having 10–15 viewers for a new streamer and only posting once or twice on social media is average. One of the reasons we had this much viewership is that before we went live, we posted on our respective social media accounts so that we could garner more viewers, and we also posted on our Google Space filled with our classmates. With both of those, we got a decent amount of viewers at 10 and a peak of 15. It wasn't only our classmates; some friends and some family members did join our livestream.</div>
